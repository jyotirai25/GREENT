            <p><h3>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</h3>
            <h2> People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Air temperature over ocean is increasing.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Temperature of the lower atmosphere is increasing.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Climate change has caused increased heat, drought, and insect outbreaks.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>. Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks.</h3></li>
